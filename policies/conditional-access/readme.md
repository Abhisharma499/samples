# Azure AD B2C sign-in with Conditional access

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Conditional Access is the tool used by Azure AD B2C to bring signals together, make decisions, and enforce organizational policies. Automating risk assessment with policy conditions means risky sign-ins are at once identified and remediated or blocked. For more information, see [Define a Conditional Access technical profile in an Azure Active Directory B2C custom policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/conditional-access-technical-profile).

## Notes

This sample policy is based on [SocialAndLocalAccounts with MFA starter pack](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-custom-policy-starterpack/tree/master/SocialAndLocalAccountsWithMfa). All changes are marked with **Sample:** comment inside the policy XML files. Make the necessary changes in the **Sample action required** sections.
